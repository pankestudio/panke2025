      title: "Our Philosophy",
      text: "At pankestudio, we believe in the power of simplicity. Our work strips away the non-essential to focus on pure form and concept. We create digital and physical art that speaks a quiet but profound language, inviting viewers to find their own meaning in the spaces we design.",

    column2: {
      title: "The Space",
      text: "Our studio is a sanctuary for creativity, designed with minimalist principles to foster focus and clarity. It's a physical manifestation of our artistic approachâ€”uncluttered, intentional, and filled with light. This environment is crucial to our process, allowing ideas to breathe and evolve without distraction.",

    longDescription: "Each piece in the Chroma Series is algorithmically generated, creating unique compositions that challenge perceptions of harmony and contrast. The project reflects on the relationship between human intention and computational creativity, resulting in visuals that are both structured and unpredictable.",
